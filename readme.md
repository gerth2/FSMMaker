# Finite State Machine Maker

A graphical tool to describe and edit finite state machines (FSM's).

Generates a java class which implements the designed state machine

It is currently a work in process.

## What's In Scope?

 * Describe FSM (Mealey or Moore) in .xml
 * Edit it in a nice, graphical editor
 * Generate code
   * Java currently supported
   * Future: C++?

## What's not yet in scope?

 * Simulating behavior prior to codegen
 * Nested FSM's.

## Why Do This?

Because I couldn't find a free tool that did graphical editing and code generation for FSM's.

I find the paradigm useful for education, particularly for the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).
