# Finite State Machine Maker

A graphical tool to describe and edit finite state machines (FSM's).

Generates a java class which implements the designed state machine

It is currently a work in process. Here's the construction plans:

## What's In Scope?

Minimum usable viable product will consist of:

 * Describe FSM (Mealey or Moore) in .xml
 * Edit it in a nice, graphical editor
 * Generate a Java Class
 * Documentation of generated code behavior

## What's not yet in scope?

The following might happen at some point, but are not part of MVP:

 * Simulating behavior prior to codegen
 * Nested FSM's.
 * Generating code to other languages.

## Why Do This?

Because I couldn't find a free tool that did graphical editing and code generation for FSM's.

I find the paradigm useful for education, particularly for the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).
